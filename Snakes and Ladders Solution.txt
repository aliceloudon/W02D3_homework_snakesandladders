Snakes and Ladders Solution

Run the program with Ruby snakes_and_ladders.rb


What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?
  - There are only 9 tiles on the board
  - It actually takes input and runs the game. Requires the players to hit the enter key to 'roll the dice'
  - What is log?

Are there any parts you don't understand?
  - Dice class: fine
  - Player class: fine
  - Snakes and ladders class: Why are we creating new instances of board, player and game in the class file? I thought we just did this in the test file.
  - Modifier?
  - Go over the last three methods in game.rb
  - Command in run_specs.sh looks new.

Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
  - Because you can't test for randomness?

Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
  - To keep the 'interactive' part of the game separate from the 'framework'
